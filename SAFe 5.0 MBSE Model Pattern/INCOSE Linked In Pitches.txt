PCS + WebEA is just showing what is there

Prolaborate is for sharing and collaborating.  

      Value add is -Prolaborate links are persistantly managed

WebEA is still for the architects.  


EA stores all data in its own database and that is separate from the Prolaborate database

	that means that there are 2 databases - at the DB level 2 are needed
	
	
	to use prolaborate we have to have a PCS token for each user!  if no Prolaborate then we only need PCS tokens for the modelers
